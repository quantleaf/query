# Quantleaf Query
Quantleaf Query is a query translation tool that lets you translate natural language into standardized query formats. The tool is semi-supervised and is easy to use, the procedure is outlined below. 

1. Desribe your schema.
2. Make a query request with the search text and your schema to the API to obtain a translated generalized query structure. 
3. Interact with the generalized query structure. As an example one can apply a transformation so that SQL or Elasticsearch Query format is obtained.
